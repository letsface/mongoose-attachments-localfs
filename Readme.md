## mongoose-attachments-localfs

Simple File System Storage Provider for [mongoose-attachments](https://github.com/firebaseco/mongoose-attachments).

### Installation

    $ npm install mongoose-attachments-localfs

### Usage

The library will register automatically with `mongoose-attachments` by performing `require` and
return a reference to the mongoose-attachments plugin:

    var attachments = require('mongoose-attachments-localfs');

For further instructions check [mongoose-attachments](https://github.com/firebaseco/mongoose-attachments).

### Provider Name

    localfs

### Example

The following snippet extends PhotoSchema to use mongoose-attachments and locate all the uploads in public directory, perfectly suited for [Express.js](http://expressjs.com) applications:

    var path = require('path');
    var attachments = require('mongoose-attachments-localfs');
    
    MySchema.plugin(attachments, {
        directory: '/absolute/path/to/public/images',
        storage : {
            providerName: 'localfs'
        },
        properties: {
            image: {
                styles: {
                    original: {
                        // keep the original file
                    },
                    thumb: {
                        thumbnail: '100x100^',
                        gravity: 'center',
                        extent: '100x100',
                        '$format': 'jpg'
                    },
                    detail: {
                        resize: '400x400>',
                        '$format': 'jpg'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    });
    MySchema.virtual('detail_img').get(function() {
        return path.join('detail', path.basename(this.image.detail.path));
    });
    MySchema.virtual('thumb_img').get(function() {
        return path.join('thumb', path.basename(this.image.thumb.path));
    });

The URL to the images would then be `http://<your host>/<mount path>/images` prepended to the value of `MyModel.detail_img` and `MyModel.thumb_img`.

For other configurations check [mongoose-attachments](https://github.com/firebaseco/mongoose-attachments).

### More Details

If you define a style called `thumb` and `directory` points to `<web-app-dir>/public/images`
When storing data into the schema, the thumbnail created by mongoose-attachemnts is stored as `<web-app-dir>/public/images/thumb/<ObjectID>-thumb.<format>`.
The absolute path to the image is stored in `Model.image.<type>.path`.
